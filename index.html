<h1>Correlation vs. Causation</h1>

    Correlation is used for analyzing the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. The correlation coefficient "r" expresses the strength of the linear relationship. r is a value between -1 and 1. the closer to 1 the stronger the positive correlation, the closer to -1 the stronger the negative correlation. If r is close to 0 then there is a weak correlation.

    Correlation does not imply Causation. Causation refers to a situation where variable A causes variable B. Correlation is just a situation where there is a relationship between A and B.

    One way to visualize relationships is to create a scatter-plot with a trend line. The scatter plot compares two variables, one on each axis. By comparing the data points to the trend line you can figure out the strength of the relationship. A scatter-plot matrix is just a combination of regular scatter-plots, this gives you the ability to visualize the relationships between multiple variables. A third way to visualize relationships is with a parallel coordinates plot. This methods differs from the previous ones because it is able to show the relationship between both categorical and quantitative data.
